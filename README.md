# Online-Retail
The provided dataset contains transactional data from an online retail store. It includes columns such as `InvoiceNo` (invoice number), `StockCode` (product code), `Description` (product description), `Quantity` (number of items), `InvoiceDate` (date and time of the invoice), `UnitPrice` (price per unit), `CustomerID` (unique identifier for customers), and `Country` (customer's country). The dataset spans multiple transactions and is likely substantial in size.

Key preprocessing steps involve:
1. Removing rows with missing `CustomerID` values.
2. Eliminating transactions with non-positive quantities and prices.
3. Creating a new feature `TotalPrice` by multiplying `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.

This cleaned dataset can be used for customer segmentation, typically via methods like K-Means clustering. Segmentation helps identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior, which can inform targeted marketing strategies and personalized services.

Analyzing this data will provide insights into customer purchasing patterns, top-selling products, and regional sales distributions, enabling the business to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.
